Two words are defined as anagrams if they do share the same letters, but are in a different order (i.e.
the english words race and care are anagrams).
Given an input file which contains one word per line, as an output construct a list of all anagrams
from that input file. Print those words to the console, where all words that are an anagram should
each other should be on the same line.
As an example, given the input file:

act
cat
tree
race
care
acre
bee

the output should be:
act cat
acre care race
